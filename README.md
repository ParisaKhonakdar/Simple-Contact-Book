##  File Structure

```
Simple-Contact-Book/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py         # The main CLI interface
â”œâ”€â”€ db.py           # Handles contact data (load/save/edit/delete)
â”œâ”€â”€ contacts.json   # Stores your contact data
â””â”€â”€ README.md       # This file
```

##  Why JSON?

We use a simple `contacts.json` file to store data. It's human-readable, easy to back up, and avoids needing a database â€” perfect for small CLI tools like this.
